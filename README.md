## React Practice Collection

This repository contains a collection of small React and Next.js practice projects. Each folder inside `React_practice` is a self‑contained app focused on a specific concept or feature.

### Projects

- **api_calling**  
  - Simple React + Vite app that demonstrates how to call APIs from React components.
  - Focuses on using `useEffect` and state to fetch and display data.

- **context_api**  
  - Practice app for React Context API.
  - Shows how to create a context provider and consume shared state from multiple components.

- **first_try**  
  - A basic Next.js app using the `app` router.
  - Useful for getting familiar with file‑based routing and layout structure in Next.js.

- **input_/input_binding**  
  - Examples of handling form inputs and two‑way binding in React.
  - Covers controlled components, input state management, and simple validation/display.

- **local_storage**  
  - Demonstrates how to read and write data to `localStorage` in a React app.
  - Useful for persisting simple user preferences or form data between page reloads.

- **react-functions**  
  - Collection of small examples showing core React hooks and patterns (e.g. state updates, list rendering, event handling).
  - Also includes a nested `react_domm` example app with additional practice components.

- **UseEffect**  
  - Focused practice with the `useEffect` hook.
  - Includes examples like timers, counters, and fetching or reacting to changing values.

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** for any project you want to run, for example:

   ```bash
   cd React_practice/api_calling
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Repeat the same steps in other project folders (such as `context_api`, `local_storage`, `react-functions`, etc.) to explore each example.

### Tech Stack

- React (Vite starter templates for most projects)
- Next.js (for the `first_try` app)
- JavaScript (with JSX) and basic CSS styling
